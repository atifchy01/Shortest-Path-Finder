## Project Overview  
The **Shortest Path Finder** is a web-based system designed to calculate the shortest path between locations using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**. The project integrates a user-friendly frontend with a robust backend to provide real-time pathfinding functionality.  

## Features  
- Efficiently calculates the shortest path between user-defined locations using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**.  
- **HashTable Map** implementation for efficient storage and management of location data.  
- Interactive **HTML** frontend for user interaction and path visualization.  
- **Java** backend to handle data processing and shortest-path computations.  
- Seamless integration of frontend and backend for a smooth user experience.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend:** HTML  
- **Backend:** Java  
- **Algorithm:** Dijkstra's Algorithm  
- **Data Structure:** HashTable Map
